     * @brief The rec cam class describes a camera that uses a rectangular projection.

     * It uses a rectangular projection, where rays are equally spaced on a 2D grid
     * ahead of the camera. This is the traditional camera projection used for rasterisation.
     * It introduces distorsion at higher fields of views, and caps at 180Â°.
     * This camera stores the result from its rays in a single image buffer, and has no
     * other effects like motion blur or aperture.
