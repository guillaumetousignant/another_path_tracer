    /**
     * @brief The rec cam motionblur class describes a camera that uses a rectangular projection and a shutter, for motion blur.
     *
     * It uses a rectangular projection, where rays are equally spaced on a 2D grid
     * ahead of the camera. This is the traditional camera projection used for rasterisation.
     * It introduces distorsion at higher fields of views, and caps at 180Â°.
     * This camera creates rays with a random time between the last state and current
     * state of the scene. This enables motion blur, as objects can use this to interpolate
     * their state at the ray's time. The rays are also created with the interpolated
     * camera state.
     * This camera stores the result from its rays in a single image buffer, and has no
     * aperture.
